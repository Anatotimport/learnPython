# Python Lab

Simple python lab for training purposes.

## Overview
This project serves the purpose of creating a simple python development laboratory for my personal training purposes

### Base software
* Ubuntu 20.10
* Vim
* Git

## How to use
* git fetch
* cd learnPython
* vagrant up
* enjoy or wait until I check portability for Virtualbox or other virtualization engines. This is still a beta, so if you need to run this on a windows bare metal and you don't know how to make this work, may be you're focusing on the trees instead of the forest.
